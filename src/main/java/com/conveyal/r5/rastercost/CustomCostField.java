/**
 * CustomCost for enabling Greenpaths2 flexible custom costs
 * This class should be utilized in r5py in the following way:
 * 
 * 1) initialize/calculate the custom cost map (e.g. from raster data)
 * which is a dict of {osmid: value} in seconds added to the base traversal time.
 * Notice that the python dict type of custom cost map needs to be converted to Java HashMap
 * 
 * 2) initialize the CustomCostField with the custom cost map and sensitivity coefficient (default 1.0)
 * ! currently the sensitivity coefficient can also be a negative number
 * but the sum of basetraversaltime + all cost fields cant be less than 1 
 * 
 * 3) add list customCost instances to the TransportNetwork.
 * List because EdgeStore's costFields is a list of CostField instances
 * also this way we can have multiple custom cost fields if wanted
 * 
 * 4) run the routing process. In the routing logic each edge will be checked for the custom cost as:
*      - go throught each edge to see how long it takes to traverse
 *     - use MultistageTraversalTimeCalculator if EdgeStore has costFields
 *     - when MultistageTraversalTimeCalculator is used, routing will add a custom cost on top of the 
 *       base traversal time for each edge. This cost is calculated using this classes additionalTraversalTimeSeconds.
 *       This method will get the osmId of the current edge and use it to get the custom cost from the custom cost hashmap
 *       using the osmid as the key. If no custom cost is found, 0 is used as default
 *       for custom cost addition, which is equivalent to no custom cost.
 * 
 *      !Note: this process is adding the custom costs as seconds on top of the base traversal time. So e.g. in matrix
 *      traveltimes the times include the additional "cost" which in this context is seconds. So actually the 
 *      custom costs are seconds. The amount of additional seconds has to be separately calculated
 *      in a "preprocessing" phase which produces the custom cost map.
